| Feature                                  | **NLTK**                                                 | **spaCy**                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Design Philosophy**                    | Research-oriented, educational                           | Industry-oriented, production-ready                       |
| **Ease of Use**                          | More granular; requires combining functions manually     | Higher-level, more streamlined for common tasks           |
| **Speed**                                | Slower; not optimized for speed                          | Much faster; optimized in Cython                          |
| **Pretrained Models**                    | Requires manual setup or training                        | Ships with powerful pretrained pipelines (NER, POS, etc.) |
| **Tokenizer**                            | Simple, rule-based                                       | Robust, context-aware tokenizer                           |
| **POS Tagging, NER, Dependency Parsing** | Basic support, often less accurate                       | Advanced models with high accuracy                        |
| **Customization**                        | Highly customizable; great for prototyping               | Customization possible, but more complex                  |
| **Corpora and Lexicons**                 | Rich selection of built-in corpora and lexical resources | Limited built-in corpora                                  |
| **Use Cases**                            | Academia, prototyping, learning NLP                      | Production NLP applications and deployment                |
| **Community & Updates**                  | Older, large academic community                          | Newer, fast-growing, focused on modern NLP needs          |


Use NLTK if you're learning NLP, need detailed linguistic data, or want to build things from scratch.

Use spaCy if you're building scalable, efficient NLP applications and need ready-to-use models.
